# CHIPS 4.8 Hello Rails!

[View this assignment on GitHub](https://github.com/saasbook/hw-hello-rails)

## Introduction

In previous assignments, you created and deployed a simple Wordguesser game using the Ruby-based Sinatra framework, and in the subsequent assignment, you explored the differences between the Rails and Sinatra versions of that same app.

In this assignment you will create your first Rails app from scratch: a simple app called RottenPotatoes (inspired by the real web site RottenTomatoes) for cataloging movies. RottenPotatoes lets users interactively (via a Web browser) create database entries for new movies, view or modify the content of movie records (movie title, rating, description, and so on), and delete movie records.  We provide some starter code you can copy and paste into specific files, but you will do most of the work.  When the app is running, you'll deploy it on the public cloud.

In later assignments, you'll add features to the app, such as the ability to filter the list of movies, the ability to associate reviews with movies, and per-user login so each user can maintain their own ratings of movies.
